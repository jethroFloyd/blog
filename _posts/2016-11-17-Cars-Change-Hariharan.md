title: Cars, Change and Hariharan
---

My RSS feed was exploding with [Uber testing self-driving cars](https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/06/watch-an-uber-self-driving-car-give-two-pittsburgh-steelers-a-ride/).

The steering wheel moving without a driver was strangely reminiscent of playing NFS II on my old PC years back with my [brother](https://professorshonku.com). I didn't think much about it for a couple of days, before the conversation somehow returned to the topic with [Don](https://dkdennis.xyz/blog/), and later with [Souro](http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/student/souroprobho.chowdhury/).

It was an enriching conversation, which threw open many apprehensions and possibilities. Finally, we managed to agree on only one thing - we cannot possibly visualise what a society with only autonomous cars would look like. We don't know what we don't know. What we know for sure is this: that society would not be autonomous cars superimposed on 2016. Autonomous cars would probably follow different traffic rules, roads and routes would look different, the way people use mass transit systems and cabs would change.

Imagining how that world would play out, with its nuances and its caveats, is a job for [story-tellers and writers](http://anuragcantwrite.blogspot.in). But we can state one thing absolute certainty: the change would not happen in isolation, in a sandbox. It would be a systemic change, that would change things as a whole.

As an aspiring entrepreneur, I like to think that being open to and embracing change is a core value. Even more important is to lead that change - to set the ball rolling, at least. This has been a fundamental value for me for as long as I remember, going back to the days when I chose my first IRC handle (a story for another time). What surprises me, however, is how often I fail to appreciate changes in the macro and micro-worlds around me. Most of the time I ignore them, sometimes I detest them, and sometimes I feel really happy about them. I wasn't being true to my principle of embracing change - of all sorts, and then working towards them. This disturbed me to an extent - for reasons I didn't know exactly then. So I decided to find out.

I noted every little thing that changed around me; and my reactions to them for a week. The results were surprising: my usual table-lamp-in-a-dark-room-setting conking off in the middle of work bothered me to no end when I had to actually work in a room filled with light. In contrast, Donald Trump's election didn't really unsettle me much. Put in perspective, my harmless tube light had me worked up more than a cunt about to be POTUS.

It taught me two important things: First, we get worked up about things we think are within our control (or where if we did enough, maybe they would be). Second, the reason we get worked up is because we thought they were within our control, but we're actually not. It was an interesting realisation. So I built a hypothesis around it: what if we try to control nothing - at least pretend not to and act accordingly - what would happen then?

The first step to test it was to shave off all the hair on my head along with a clean shave. The moment the razor started its work, I felt awesome. I no longer cared about what people would think of my shaven and bald baby-face. It was actually fun - my gait changed almost inexplicably for the better, and I acquired a couple of hats and aviators just like that.

I had no idea how liberating it would be. So I took it one step further - I decided to try and see if I could come to terms with other changes around me, no matter how outrageous. Don't get me wrong - accepting a change doesn't mean you agree to it. But you acknowledge that it has happened. Denying it is an exercise in futility, because - well, I don't know how to explain this in any other way- it _has already_ happened. Once you acknowledge the change, it now opens up a whole new world of possibilities of what you could do about _after_ the change, not _about_ it. 

People, I think, resist change because it's unusual, and it doesn't fit the pattern already in their heads. They want things to be overwhelmingly like a certain moment in the past when they felt really good. They are afraid that they might lose it. The fact is that they've already lost it. That moment came, and went. If we stepped out of it, maybe we could just admit that we don't know what we don't know - the future. At that point, we are free to do what we want to shape it, or just watch it unfold. We don't know what a world with autonomous cars, or AI, or nuclear warheads, or states without borders would look like. But we could try to build it. We could try to not be upset or elated about every turn in the road - knowing that they are part of a bigger mosaic, and adapt and act accordingly _after the fact_, not while denying it or crying over how great it would have been if it hadn't happened at all (don't tell me Bernie wouldn't have been better than Hillary). The fundamental improvement I've seen in myself is that I've become more constructive rather than reactionary in a matter of weeks (not that I've reached zen. Not yet. Last evening I ranted on a friend's Facebook post in a rather untoward and uncalled for manner. Apologies, Shinjini). 

All of this had been happening while I was travelling from here and there. Last week, I was supposed to take a 5 am flight to New Delhi from Kolkata. My father decided to drop me off at the airport despite my usual protests at that ungodly hour. While we were speeding down E.M. Bypass, I put the [Colonial Cousins MTV Unplugged version of Tu Hi Re on the car stereo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zq7Hu23iC1A). My father was surprised at first hearing a different, much less intense version of his favourite Hari Haran song that he swears by. He paused for a moment, and then shrugged, "Well... it's a change."

I felt weirdly nice.
