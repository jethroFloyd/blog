title:  It's Only Science When It's Political
---

I am from Kolkata and I speak Bangla, that ipso facto makes me a *Bangali*.  There's an old joke which says:
> If you have one *Bangali*, you have a political opinion.
> If you have two *Bangalis*, you have a political party.
> If you have three *Bangalis*, you have two political parties.

Unfortunately, this trend seems to restrict itself only to political ideas that relate either to the latest gubernatorial scandal, or the dream of a revolution. And it's dangerously alarming: not only is political thought considered a waste of time, mingling politics with science is a topic that no one wants to talk about.

 And I'm not even talking about opinions like this one, expressed in a blogpost somewhere: [apparently](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/feb/29/scientific-advisers-ignored-lords-report), politics most often than not chooses to ignore science, or its counsels. The retort is expected: science, too, chooses to distance itself from politics. True, the [EFF](https://www.eff.org) exists, and a handful of climate scientists have built consortiums; but what fraction of today's students, professionals, academia and the general public do they represent? I don't have figures to quote on this, but intuitively, I can guess that it would be abysmal.
 
 The problem is not new - the relationship has always been uneasy at best - but the effects are exponentially increasing with each passing second. Technology is developing and impacting lives around the world at an unprecedented rate. A nuclear physicist today cannot claim that he is apolitical: it would be hilarious. His work is implicitly political - in terms of shifting boundaries, warfare, energy and definitions of power.
 
 On similar lines, environmental scientists should hardly be just scientists any more: their involvement in shaping public policy is inevitable, and the obvious way forward. In the age of information being the new currency (quite literally so, with the advent of cryptocurrencies), cryptographers are not math and prime-number wielding wizards any more. They are guardians of privacy, rights and freedom. 
 
 In the next few blog posts, I plan to iterate over ideas and experiences around this; but the theme should be explicitly clear from this introductory post: science and politics must walk together; otherwise it'd be a great shame.
