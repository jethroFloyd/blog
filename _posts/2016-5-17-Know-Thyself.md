Or not.

I have devoted a significant part of my time and effort muddling in cryptography and security. I have looked at it from different points of view: I started out with [XSS](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cross-site_scripting) and [XSRF](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cross-site_request_forgery) in those golden days of naked scripts roaming around everywhere. Then I shifted to the mathematics of it for some time. Then I went back. And forth.

In the past few months, however, I have started to question my interests from a different perspective. Perhaps this is also closely related to my [recent awakening](http://ritobrotom.com/blog/Science-Politics-1/) and further cemented over communications and debates with my friend, [Souro](http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/student/souroprobho.chowdhury/). 

All of cryptography, privacy and security is about hiding your communication, your personal information or your identity; either selectively or with a blanket. And all of us who have attended Crypto 101 Lecture 1 know why the technology to enable this must be pursued with much vim and vigour: to protect your credit card details, to hide your passwords and to lock your wife out of your secret chats. However, if we go beyond these well-studied and discussed questions, we arrive at one that is much larger, possibly unanswered and one that needs a debate much larger than the one going on now. And the question is simple: Why?

Here, I digress a little. Questions that are so simple are often misconstrued (no matter how elegant and dramatic they seem on the surface). I am not questioning the utility of cryptography. I am rather questioning why it is needed in the first place - and not in the context of banking passwords, for which the answers are well-known (and have immediate financial implications). It is in fact amazing how much of cryptography has come up to facilitate secure transactions. I am interested in knowing why people feel the need to use anonymising services like Tor. I am interested in knowing who would want to use it, and why they want to use it.

Most people who are privacy-fanatics actually view it from a romantic sense: users of Telegram, or WhatsApp End-to-End Encryption, or the erstwhile LavaBit are rarely people who actually need it; most of us act from paranoia. Which is one very valid use-case, based on apprehension. It raises the obvious question - who are the **real** intended end-users of anonymising services? (I am aware that I have used that term quite liberally and twice - I hope that a more technical reader will ignore the language and focus on the spirit). What are the intended use-cases? Are they only for the whistleblowers and the conspirators? The revolutionaries and the black market? Or are there use-cases for more run-of-the-mill people too? People who are just concerned with their privacy?

That leads to another important question - do we have a right to privacy in our digital lives? Laws are dreadfully obscure about this; the debate about what is personally identifiable information and what is not, and the famous metadata stories have been discussed so many times without conclusions that it is fruitless to write about it here. Neither is it the objective of this post - if you have not figured out already, this post is not about writing the answers; it is merely about asking the questions for now. Who really uses encryption? Who really needs encryption? Why would someone be inclined to not disclose their identity or communication? (That's a bomb of a question by the way - if you have nothing to hide, why are you hiding?) 

Or should I have the choice of disclosing or not disclosing something to an individual, an institute or a state, unless served by a warrant - just like in the case of physical properties? Do we have that choice today? 
Eventually, all of the myriad brain-maps that can be drawn from the questions above boil down to a handful. If I consider a broad definition of identity that covers patterns of my conversation and my social actions (versus the traditional legal name definition of an identity), then why would I be inclined to hide a portion of it?

I am interested in this question irrespective of whether it is legal, moral or ethical to do so. Those are secondary still. But the question of fully or partially anonymising oneself or one's action is inextricably linked to the question of identity itself. The first and foremost question, then, that we would need to answer is this: what constitutes my identity? What constitutes my digital identity? Are they the same, or are they different? Are they related?

And that's where I am stuck now. I expect to go deeper into the question of what constitutes an identity in the digital world and how different or similar it might be to the physical or social worlds soon. I am not sure how I arrived over these years from simple hacks to questioning identities and therefore anonymity; but it's been an interesting journey so far. More on this soon.
